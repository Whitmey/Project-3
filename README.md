- **A**ngular - For the client-side framework
- **N**ode - For the server-side language
---
#### Server-side

Your app must:
* **Use Mongo, Node & Express** to build a server-side API
* **Your API must have at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Your API should include **all RESTFUL actions** for at least one of those models
* Include **authentication** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document**, however don't go crazy! You need to manage your time effectively...

#### Client-side
* **Use Angular** to build a front-end that consumes your API
* **Use SCSS instead of CSS**
* **Use Bower** to manage your client-side dependencies
* **Use Gulp & Babel** to convert your ES6 code to ES5
* **Use Gulp & Sass** to convert your SCSS code to CSS

### Necessary Deliverables
* A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A handmade Angular front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project.





* **A `readme.md` file** with:
	* Explanations of the **technologies** used
   	* A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
   	* **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
   	* Link to your **wireframes** â€“ sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome
